    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <pre><div>chunker(text.var, grouping.var&nbsp;=&nbsp;NULL, n.words, n.chunks, as.string&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE, rm.unequal&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE)</div></pre>
    
    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>text.var</dt>
      <dd>The text variable</dd>
      <dt>grouping.var</dt>
      <dd>The grouping variables.  Default <code>NULL</code> generates
one word list for all text.  Also takes a single grouping variable or a list
of 1 or more grouping variables.</dd>
      <dt>n.words</dt>
      <dd>An integer specifying the number of words in each chunk (must
specify n.chunks or n.words).</dd>
      <dt>n.chunks</dt>
      <dd>An integer specifying the number of chunks (must specify
n.chunks or n.words).</dd>
      <dt>as.string</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> the chunks are returned as a single
string.  If <code>FALSE</code> the chunks are returned as a vector of single words.</dd>
      <dt>rm.unequal</dt>
      <dd>logical. If <code>TRUE</code> final chunks that are unequal in
length to the other chunks are removed.</dd>

    <div class="Description">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      
      <p>Some visualizations and algorithms require text to be broken into chunks of
ordered words.  <code>chunker</code> breaks text, optionally by grouping
variables, into equal chunks.  The chunk size can be specified by giving
number of words to be in each chunk or the number of chunks.</p>

christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature&#39;s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that&#39;s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you
