<strong class='message'>===================================
Event 1: [lines 19-21]

    ROMNEY: The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?

 ** ROMNEY: We have to have the benefits high for those that are low
            income, but for higher income people, we&#39;re going to have
            to lower some of the benefits.

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term. 

===================================
Event 2: [lines 22-24]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that I&#39;ve put forward.

 ** ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality. 

===================================
Event 3: [lines 38-40]

    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.

 ** OBAMA:  but but but overall.

    LEHRER: OK. 

===================================
Event 4: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 

===================================
Event 5: [lines 122-124]

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe.

 ** ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts.

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. 

===================================
Event 6: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
            not qualified, there are big penalties, except they
            didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage
            was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 

===================================
Event 7: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.

 ** OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all.
