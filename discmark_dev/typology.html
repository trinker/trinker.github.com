<strong class='message'>===================================
Event 1: [lines 41-43]

    OBAMA:     And so|

 ** ROMNEY:    That&#39;s &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; big topic.

    ROMNEY:    Can we can we stay on Medicare? 

===================================
Event 2: [lines 98-100]

    ROMNEY:    You need transparency, you need to have leverage
               limits for|

 ** LEHRER:    Well, &lt;&lt;here&#39;s a&gt;&gt; specific|

    ROMNEY:    But let&#39;s let&#39;s mention let me mention the other one. 

===================================
Event 3: [lines 103-105]

    LEHRER:    Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
               specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just
               said.

 ** OBAMA:     I think this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; great example.

    OBAMA:     The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
               crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
               board. 

===================================
Event 4: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER:    I think we have another clear difference between the
               two of you.

 ** LEHRER:    Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there &lt;&lt;is
               a&gt;&gt; clear difference, and that has to do with the
               Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER:    And &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; two minute new new segment, and that
               means two minutes each. 

===================================
Event 5: [lines 146-148]

    LEHRER:    Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there &lt;&lt;is
               a&gt;&gt; clear difference, and that has to do with the
               Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

 ** LEHRER:    And &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; two minute new new segment, and that
               means two minutes each.

    LEHRER:    And you go first, Governor Romney. 

===================================
Event 6: [lines 228-230]

    OBAMA:     And I agree that the Democratic legislators in
               Massachusetts might have given some advice to
               Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but
               the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers,
               and they say it&#39;s the same plan.

 ** OBAMA:     It when Governor Romney talks about this board, for
               example, unelected board that we&#39;ve created, what this
               is, &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; group of health care experts, doctors, et
               cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of
               care in the system overall?

    OBAMA:     Because there there are two ways of dealing with our
               health care crisis. 

===================================
Event 7: [lines 254-256]

    LEHRER:    How would you replace it?

 ** ROMNEY:    Well, actually it&#39;s it&#39;s &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; lengthy
               description.

    ROMNEY:    But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered
               under my plan. 

===================================
Event 8: [lines 280-282]

    OBAMA:     But that&#39;s already the law and that doesn&#39;t help the
               millions of people out there with preexisting
               conditions.

 ** OBAMA:     &lt;&lt;There&#39;s a&gt;&gt; reason why Governor Romney set up the
               plan that he did in Massachusetts.

    OBAMA:     It wasn&#39;t a government takeover of health care. 

===================================
Event 9: [lines 320-322]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s part of my health care plan.

 ** ROMNEY:    And what we did in Massachusetts &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; model for
               the nation state by state.

    ROMNEY:    And I said that at that time. 

===================================
Event 10: [lines 323-325]

    ROMNEY:    The federal government taking over health care for the
               entire nation and whisking aside the tenth Amendment,
               which gives states the rights for these kinds of
               things, is not the course for America to have a
               stronger, more vibrant economy.

 ** LEHRER:    That &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; terrific segue to our next segment, and
               is the role of government.

    LEHRER:    And and let&#39;s see. 

===================================
Event 11: [lines 328-330]

    LEHRER:    And the question is this.

 ** LEHRER:    Do you believe, both of you but you had the first two
               minutes on this, Mister President do you believe
               &lt;&lt;there&#39;s a&gt;&gt; fundamental difference between the two
               of you as to how you view the mission of the federal
               government?

    OBAMA:     Well, I definitely think there are differences. 

===================================
Event 12: [lines 405-407]

    OBAMA:     Let me just finish the point.

 ** OBAMA:     The where they&#39;re partnering so that they&#39;re designing
               training progra Miss And people who are going through
               them know that &lt;&lt;there&#39;s a&gt;&gt; job waiting for them if
               they complete it.

    OBAMA:     That makes a big difference, but that requires some
               federal support. 

===================================
Event 13: [lines 467-469]

    ROMNEY:    And Republicans and Democrats both love America.

 ** ROMNEY:    But we need to have leadership leadership in
               Washington that will actually bring people together
               and get the job done and could not care less if if
               &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; Republican or a Democrat.

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;ve done it before. 

===================================
Event 14: [lines 509-511]

    ROMNEY:    And thank you for tuning in this evening.

 ** ROMNEY:    This &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; this is an important election and I&#39;m
               concerned about America.

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;m concerned about the direction America has been
               taking over the last four years. 

===================================
Event 15: [lines 577-579]

    ROMNEY:    We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids
               to afford college.

 ** ROMNEY:    And also make sure that when they get out of college,
               &lt;&lt;there&#39;s a&gt;&gt; job.

    ROMNEY:    When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high
               school degree, you had to pass an exam. 

===================================
Event 16: [lines 579-581]

    ROMNEY:    When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high
               school degree, you had to pass an exam.

 ** ROMNEY:    If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines,
               we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four
               years tuition free in the college of your choice in
               Massachusetts, &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; public institution.

    ROMNEY:    I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program
               growing. 

===================================
Event 17: [lines 751-753]

    OBAMA:     We&#39;re encouraging it and working with the industry.

 ** OBAMA:     And when I hear Governor Romney say &lt;&lt;he&#39;s a&gt;&gt; big
               coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when Governor, when
               you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front
               of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant
               kills, and took great pride in shutting it down.

    OBAMA:     And now suddenly you&#39;re a big champion of coal. 

===================================
Event 18: [lines 1023-1025]

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;ve done it my entire life.

 ** ROMNEY:    So for instance when he says, Yours &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; dollar
               five trillion cut.

    ROMNEY:    Well, no it&#39;s not. 

===================================
Event 19: [lines 1038-1040]

    QUESTION:  In what new ways to you intend to rectify the
               inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding
               females making only seventy two percent of what their
               male counterparts earn?

 ** OBAMA:     Well, Katherine, &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; great question.

    OBAMA:     And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to
               put herself through school while looking after two
               kids. 

===================================
Event 20: [lines 1051-1053]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s an example of the kind of advocacy that we
               need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners
               in the family.

 ** OBAMA:     This is not just a women&#39;s issue, this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; family
               issue, this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; middle class issue, and that&#39;s
               why we&#39;ve got to fight for it.

    OBAMA:     It also means that we&#39;ve got to make sure that young
               people like yourself are able to afford a college
               education. 

===================================
Event 21: [lines 1099-1101]

    OBAMA:     You know a major difference in this campaign is that
               Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians
               in Washington decide the health care choices that
               women are making.

 ** OBAMA:     I think &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; mistake.

    OBAMA:     In my health care bill, I said insurance companies
               need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody
               who is insured. 

===================================
Event 22: [lines 1107-1109]

    OBAMA:     When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate
               funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of
               women all across the country, who rely on Planned
               Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely
               on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.

 ** OBAMA:     &lt;&lt;That&#39;s a&gt;&gt; pocketbook issue for women and families
               all across the country.

    OBAMA:     And it makes a difference in terms of how well and
               effectively women are able to work. 

===================================
Event 23: [lines 1163-1165]

    ROMNEY:    I want regulators to see their job as encouraging
               small enterprise, not crushing it.

 ** ROMNEY:    And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama
               Care, well &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; long list, but one of the things
               I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk
               to small businesses and ask them what they think about
               it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more
               people.

    ROMNEY:    My priority is jobs. 

===================================
Event 24: [lines 1192-1194]

    OBAMA:     In some ways, he&#39;s gone to a more extreme place when
               it comes to social policy.

 ** OBAMA:     And I think &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; mistake.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s not how we&#39;re going to move our economy
               forward. 

===================================
Event 25: [lines 1257-1259]

    ROMNEY:    Didn&#39;t even file it.

 ** ROMNEY:    This &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; president who has not been able to do
               what he said he&#39;d do.

    ROMNEY:    He said that he&#39;d cut in half the deficit. 

===================================
Event 26: [lines 1313-1315]

    ROMNEY:    And let me step back and tell you what I would like to
               do with our immigration policy broadly and include an
               answer to your question.

 ** ROMNEY:    But first of all, this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; nation of immigrants.

    ROMNEY:    We welcome people coming to this country as
               immigrants. 

===================================
Event 27: [lines 1315-1317]

    ROMNEY:    We welcome people coming to this country as
               immigrants.

 ** ROMNEY:    My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann&#39;s
               dad was born in Wales and &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; first generation
               American.

    ROMNEY:    We welcome legal immigrants into this country. 

===================================
Event 28: [lines 1338-1340]

    ROMNEY:    Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would
               have provided an answer for those that want to come
               legally and for those that are here illegally today?

 ** ROMNEY:    &lt;&lt;What&#39;s a&gt;&gt; question I think the the president will
               have a chance to answer right now.

    OBAMA:     Good, I look forward to it. 

===================================
Event 29: [lines 1435-1437]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s his policy.

 ** OBAMA:     And &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt; bad policy.

    OBAMA:     And it won&#39;t help us grow. 

===================================
Event 30: [lines 1489-1491]

    ROMNEY:    I I&#39;m I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families
               of those who lost loved ones.

 ** ROMNEY:    And today &lt;&lt;there&#39;s a&gt;&gt; memorial service for one of
               those that was lost in this tragedy.

    ROMNEY:    We we think of their families and care for them
               deeply. 

===================================
Event 31: [lines 1580-1582]

    OBAMA:     And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that
               young people have opportunity; that our schools are
               working; that if there&#39;s violence on the streets, that
               working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can
               catch it before it gets out of control.

 ** OBAMA:     And so what I want &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; comprehensive
               strategy.

    OBAMA:     Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons
               that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of
               criminals and the mentally ill. 

===================================
Event 32: [lines 1668-1670]

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s too high.

 ** OBAMA:     But &lt;&lt;there&#39;s a&gt;&gt; difference in terms of how we would
               do it.

    OBAMA:     I want to close loopholes that allow companies to
               deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow
               them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so
               they have tax advantages offshore. 

===================================
Event 33: [lines 1702-1704]

    ROMNEY:    Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our
               designs, our patents, our technology.

 ** ROMNEY:    There&#39;s even an Apple store in China &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt;
               counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods.

    ROMNEY:    They hack into our computers. 

===================================
Event 34: [lines 1733-1735]

    QUESTION:  Hi, Governor.

 ** QUESTION:  I think this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; tough question.

    QUESTION:  To each of you. 

===================================
Event 35: [lines 1781-1783]

    OBAMA:     And and that is part of what&#39;s at stake in this
               election.

 ** OBAMA:     &lt;&lt;There&#39;s a&gt;&gt; fundamentally different vision about how
               we move our country forward.

    OBAMA:     I believe Governor Romney &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; good man. 

===================================
Event 36: [lines 1782-1784]

    OBAMA:     &lt;&lt;There&#39;s a&gt;&gt; fundamentally different vision about how
               we move our country forward.

 ** OBAMA:     I believe Governor Romney &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; good man.

    OBAMA:     Loves his family, cares about his faith. 

===================================
Event 37: [lines 1816-1818]

    SCHIEFFER: Tonight&#39;s debate, as both of you know, comes on the
               fiftyth anniversary of the night that President
               Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had
               installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the
               closest we&#39;ve ever come to nuclear war.

 ** SCHIEFFER: And it &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; sobering reminder that every president
               faces at some point an unexpected threat to our
               national security from abroad.

    SCHIEFFER: So let&#39;s begin. 

===================================
Event 38: [lines 1848-1850]

    ROMNEY:    We have in in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president.

 ** ROMNEY:    And so what we&#39;re seeing &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; pretty dramatic
               reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.

    ROMNEY:    Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four
               years closer to a nuclear weapon. 

===================================
Event 39: [lines 1855-1857]

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s certainly not hiding.

 ** ROMNEY:    This &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; group that is now involved in ten or
               twelve countries, and it presents an enormous threat
               to our friends, to the world, to America, long term,
               and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help
               reject this kind of extremism.

    SCHIEFFER: Mister President? 

===================================
Event 40: [lines 1874-1876]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s that&#39;s important, of course.

 ** ROMNEY:    But the key that we&#39;re going to have to pursue &lt;&lt;is
               a&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; pathway to get the Muslim world to be
               able to reject extremism on its own.

    ROMNEY:    We don&#39;t want another Iraq, we don&#39;t want another
               Afghanistan. 

===================================
Event 41: [lines 1894-1896]

    ROMNEY:    We want we want to make sure that we&#39;re seeing
               progress throughout the Middle East.

 ** ROMNEY:    With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al
               Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to to kill,
               to murder his own people, this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; region in
               tumult.

    ROMNEY:    And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon,
               we&#39;ve got real. 

===================================
Event 42: [lines 1897-1899]

    SCHIEFFER: We&#39;ll get to that, but let&#39;s give the president a
               chance.

 ** OBAMA:     Governor Romney, I&#39;m glad that you recognize that Al
               Qaida &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; threat, because a few months ago when
               you were asked what&#39;s the biggest geopolitical threat
               facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you
               said Russia, in the one thousand nine hundred eightys,
               they&#39;re now calling to ask for their foreign policy
               back because, you know, the Cold War&#39;s been over for
               twenty years.

    OBAMA:     But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you
               seem to want to import the foreign policies of the one
               thousand nine hundred eightys, just like the social
               policies of the one thousand nine hundred fiftys and
               the economic policies of the one thousand nine hundred
               twentys. 

===================================
Event 43: [lines 1917-1919]

    ROMNEY:    But I&#39;ll respond to a couple of things that you
               mentioned.

 ** ROMNEY:    First of all, Russia I indicated &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; geopolitical
               foe.

    ROMNEY:    Not| 

===================================
Event 44: [lines 1920-1922]

    ROMNEY:    Excuse me.

 ** ROMNEY:    &lt;&lt;It&#39;s a&gt;&gt; geopolitical foe, and I said in the same in
               the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest
               national security threat we face.

    ROMNEY:    Russia does continue to battle us in the U. 

===================================
Event 45: [lines 1945-1947]

    ROMNEY:    No, I|

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;m sorry &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt;|

    OBAMA:     You you| 

===================================
Event 46: [lines 1947-1949]

    OBAMA:     You you|

 ** ROMNEY:    &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; I indicated|

    OBAMA:     major speech. 

===================================
Event 47: [lines 1960-1962]

    OBAMA:     And so what I&#39;ve done throughout my presidency and
               will continue to do is, number one, make sure that
               these countries are supporting our counterterrorism
               efforts.

 ** OBAMA:     Number two, make sure that they are standing by our
               interests in Israel&#39;s security, because it &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt;
               true friend and our greatest ally in the region.

    OBAMA:     Number three, we do have to make sure that we&#39;re
               protecting religious minorities and women because
               these countries can&#39;t develop unless all the
               population, not just half of it, is developing. 

===================================
Event 48: [lines 1985-1987]

    OBAMA:     This what we&#39;re seeing taking place in Syria is
               heartbreaking, and that&#39;s why we are going to do
               everything we can to make sure that we are helping the
               opposition.

 ** OBAMA:     But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us
               to get more entangled militarily in Syria &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt;
               serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely
               certain that we know who we are helping; that we&#39;re
               not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually
               could turn them against us or allies in the region.

    OBAMA:     And I am confident that Assad&#39;s days are numbered. 

===================================
Event 49: [lines 1987-1989]

    OBAMA:     And I am confident that Assad&#39;s days are numbered.

 ** OBAMA:     But what we can&#39;t do is to simply suggest that, as
               Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving
               heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition
               &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; simple proposition that would lead us to be
               safer over the long term.

    SCHIEFFER: Governor? 

===================================
Event 50: [lines 1990-1992]

    ROMNEY:    Well, let&#39;s step back and talk about what&#39;s happening
               in Syria and how important it is.

 ** ROMNEY:    First of all, thirty thousand people being killed by
               their government &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; humanitarian disaster.

    ROMNEY:    Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria
               plays an important role in the Middle East,
               particularly right now. 

===================================
Event 51: [lines 1995-1997]

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon,
               which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.

 ** ROMNEY:    And so seeing Syria remove Assad &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; very high
               priority for us.

    ROMNEY:    Number two, seeing a a replacement government being
               responsible people is critical for us. 

===================================
Event 52: [lines 2010-2012]

    ROMNEY:    But I believe we want to make sure that we have the
               relationships of friendship with the people that take
               his place, steps that in the years to come we see
               Syria as a as a friend, and Syria as a responsible
               party in the Middle East.

 ** ROMNEY:    This this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; critical opportunity for America.

    ROMNEY:    And what I&#39;m afraid of is we&#39;ve watched over the past
               year or so, first the president saying, well we&#39;ll let
               the U. 

===================================
Event 53: [lines 2037-2039]

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t want to have our military involved in Syria.

 ** ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t think there &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; necessity to put our
               military in Syria at this stage.

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t anticipate that in the future. 

===================================
Event 54: [lines 2046-2048]

    ROMNEY:    But look, this has been going on for a year.

 ** ROMNEY:    This &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; time this should have been a time for
               American leadership.

    ROMNEY:    We should have taken a leading role, not militarily,
               but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to
               bring together the parties; to find responsible
               parties. 

===================================
Event 55: [lines 2071-2073]

    OBAMA:     They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.

 ** OBAMA:     That &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; red line for us, because not only is
               Israel&#39;s security at stake, but our security is at
               stake if that unravels.

    OBAMA:     They have to make sure that they&#39;re cooperating with
               us when it comes to counterterrorism. 

===================================
Event 56: [lines 2097-2099]

    ROMNEY:    Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.

 ** ROMNEY:    When the when the president of Iraq excuse me, of
               Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a
               great country, &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; frightening thing.

    ROMNEY:    Former chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that
               Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest
               national security threat we face. 

===================================
Event 57: [lines 2114-2116]

    ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s because we&#39;ve become weaker in each of
               those four|

 ** SCHIEFFER: you&#39;re going to get a chance to respond to that,
               because &lt;&lt;that&#39;s a&gt;&gt; perfect segue into our next
               segment, and that is, what is America&#39;s role in the
               world?

    SCHIEFFER: And that is the question. 

===================================
Event 58: [lines 2181-2183]

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;re all focused on China.

 ** ROMNEY:    Latin America &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; huge opportunity for us time
               zone, language opportunities.

    ROMNEY:    Number three, we&#39;re going to have to have training
               programs that work for our workers and schools that
               finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids
               first, and the teachers&#39; unions going to have to go
               behind. 

===================================
Event 59: [lines 2258-2260]

    ROMNEY:    We take program after program that we don&#39;t absolutely
               have to have, and we get rid of them.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to
               keep, like Medicaid, which &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; program for the
               poor; we&#39;ll take that healthcare program for the poor
               and we give it to the states to run because states run
               these programs more efficiently.

    ROMNEY:    As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. 

===================================
Event 60: [lines 2285-2287]

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s driven by, what are we going to need to keep the
               American people safe?

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s exactly what our budget does, and it also then
               allows us to reduce our deficit, which &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt;
               significant national security concern.

    OBAMA:     Because we&#39;ve got to make sure that our economy is
               strong at home so that we can project military power
               overseas. 

===================================
Event 61: [lines 2310-2312]

    ROMNEY:    Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility
               of the President of the United States, which is to
               maintain the safety of the American people.

 ** ROMNEY:    And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion
               dollars, which &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; combination of the budget cuts
               the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.

    ROMNEY:    That, in my view, is making is making our future less
               certain and less secure. 

===================================
Event 62: [lines 2335-2337]

    SCHIEFFER: Mister President?

 ** OBAMA:     First of all, Israel &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; true friend.

    OBAMA:     It is our greatest ally in the region. 

===================================
Event 63: [lines 2350-2352]

    OBAMA:     So their economy is in a shambles.

 ** OBAMA:     And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran
               &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; threat to our national security, and it &lt;&lt;is
               a&gt;&gt; threat to Israel&#39;s national security.

    OBAMA:     We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the
               most volatile region of the world. 

===================================
Event 64: [lines 2352-2354]

    OBAMA:     We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the
               most volatile region of the world.

 ** OBAMA:     Iran &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; state sponsor of terrorism.

    OBAMA:     And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology
               to non state actors, that&#39;s unacceptable. 

===================================
Event 65: [lines 2406-2408]

    OBAMA:     We started from the day we got into office.

 ** OBAMA:     And the reason is was so important and this &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt;
               testament to how we&#39;ve restored American credibility
               and strength around the world is we had to make sure
               that all the countries participated, even countries
               like Russia and China.

    OBAMA:     Because if it&#39;s just us that are imposing sanctions
               we&#39;ve had sanctions in place a long time. 

===================================
Event 66: [lines 2410-2412]

    OBAMA:     And we&#39;ve got to maintain that pressure.

 ** OBAMA:     There &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; deal to be had, and that is that they
               abide by the rules that have already been established.

    OBAMA:     They convince the international community they are not
               pursuing a nuclear program. 

===================================
Event 67: [lines 2583-2585]

    ROMNEY:    No, it&#39;s not time to divorce a nation on Earth that
               has one hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to
               double that at some point, a nation that has serious
               threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I
               indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.

 ** ROMNEY:    &lt;&lt;It&#39;s a&gt;&gt; nation that&#39;s not like like others and it
               does not have a civilian leadership that is calling
               the shots there.

    ROMNEY:    You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is
               probably the most powerful of the of three branches
               there. 

===================================
Event 68: [lines 2586-2588]

    ROMNEY:    Then you have the military and then you have the
               civilian government.

 ** ROMNEY:    This &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; nation, which, if it falls apart, if it
               if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear
               weapons there and you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got terrorists
               there who could grab their their hands onto those
               nuclear weapons.

    ROMNEY:    This is this is an important part of the world for us. 

===================================
Event 69: [lines 2636-2638]

    OBAMA:     homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.

 ** SCHIEFFER: Let&#39;s let&#39;s go to the next segment, because &lt;&lt;it&#39;s a&gt;&gt;
               very important one.

    SCHIEFFER: It is the rise of China and future challenges for
               America. 

===================================
Event 70: [lines 2660-2662]

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s not government investments that makes businesses
               grow and hire people.

 ** ROMNEY:    Let me also note that the greatest threat that the
               world faces, the greatest national security threat
               &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; nuclear Iran.

    ROMNEY:    Let&#39;s talk about China. 

===================================
Event 71: [lines 2699-2701]

    ROMNEY:    And there&#39;s one going on right now, which we don&#39;t
               know about it.

 ** ROMNEY:    &lt;&lt;It&#39;s a&gt;&gt; silent one.

    ROMNEY:    And they&#39;re winning. 

===================================
Event 72: [lines 2734-2736]

    OBAMA:     And when it comes to our military and Chinese
               security, part of the reason that we were able to
               pivot to the Asia Pacific region after having ended
               the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan,
               is precisely because this is going to be a massive
               growth area in the future.

 ** OBAMA:     And we believe China can be a partner, but we&#39;re also
               sending a very clear signal that America &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt;
               Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence
               there.

    OBAMA:     We are working with countries in the region to make
               sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that
               commerce continues. 

===================================
Event 73: [lines 2775-2777]

    ROMNEY:    Investing in Solyndra.

 ** ROMNEY:    This &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; company, this isn&#39;t basic research.

    ROMNEY:    I I want to invest in research. 

===================================
Event 74: [lines 2882-2884]

    ROMNEY:    And there are two very different paths the country can
               take.

 ** ROMNEY:    One &lt;&lt;is a&gt;&gt; path represented by the president, which
               at the end of four years would mean we&#39;d have dollar
               twenty trillion in debt heading towards Greece.

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;ll get us on track to a balanced budget.

    LEHRER:    Beginning with you.

 ** LEHRER:    This &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; new two minute segment to start.

    LEHRER:    And we&#39;ll go for a few minutes, and then we&#39;re going
               to go to health care, OK?

Event 2: [lines 285-287]

    OBAMA:     Now, that also means that you&#39;ve got more customers.

 ** OBAMA:     But when when Governor Romney says that he&#39;ll replace
               it with something, but can&#39;t detail how it will be in
               fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he
               did in Massachusetts was because there &lt;&lt;isn&#39;t a&gt;&gt;
               better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions
               problem.

    OBAMA:     It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he&#39;s
               going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax
               plan. 

===================================
Event 3: [lines 1087-1089]

    ROMNEY:    And an economy with seven.

 ** ROMNEY:    eight percent unemployment &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; real strong
               economy.

    ROMNEY:    An economy that has twenty three million people
               looking for work &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; strong economy. 

===================================
Event 4: [lines 1088-1090]

    ROMNEY:    eight percent unemployment &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; real strong
               economy.

 ** ROMNEY:    An economy that has twenty three million people
               looking for work &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; strong economy.

    ROMNEY:    An economy with fifty percent of kids graduating from
               college that can&#39;t finds a job, or a college level
               job, that&#39;s not what we have to have. 

===================================
Event 5: [lines 1909-1911]

    OBAMA:     So, what what we need to do with respect to the Middle
               East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and
               reckless leadership that is all over the map.

 ** OBAMA:     And unfortunately, that&#39;s the kind of opinions that
               you&#39;ve offered throughout this campaign, and it &lt;&lt;is
               not a&gt;&gt; recipe for American strength, or keeping
               America safe over the long haul.

    SCHIEFFER: I&#39;m going to add a couple of minutes here to give you
               a chance to respond. 

===================================
Event 6: [lines 1957-1959]

    OBAMA:     You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you
               said we should still have troops in Iraq.

 ** OBAMA:     That &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; recipe for making sure that we are
               taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the
               challenges of the Middle East.

    OBAMA:     Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet
               these challenges militarily. 

===================================
Event 7: [lines 2323-2325]

    OBAMA:     We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear
               submarines.

 ** OBAMA:     And so the question &lt;&lt;is not a&gt;&gt; game of Battleship,
               where we&#39;re counting slips.

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s what are our capabilities. 

===================================
Event 8: [lines 2815-2817]

    OBAMA:     But more importantly it is true that in order for us
               to be competitive, we&#39;re going to have to make some
               smart choices right now.

 ** OBAMA:     Cutting our education budget, &lt;&lt;that&#39;s not a&gt;&gt; smart
               choice.

    OBAMA:     That will not help us compete with China. 

===================================
Event 9: [lines 2817-2819]

    OBAMA:     That will not help us compete with China.

 ** OBAMA:     Cutting our investments in research and technology,
               &lt;&lt;that&#39;s not a&gt;&gt; smart choice.

    OBAMA:     That will not help us compete with China.
