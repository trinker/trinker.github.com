    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <pre>cm_distance(dataframe, pvals = c(TRUE, FALSE), replications = 1000, parallel = TRUE, 
  extended.output = TRUE, time.var = TRUE, code.var = "code", causal = FALSE, start.var = "start", 
      end.var = "end", cores = detectCores()/2)</pre>
    
    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>dataframe</dt>
      <dd>A data frame from the cm_x2long family
  (<code>cm_range2long</code>; <code>cm_df2long</code>;
  <code>cm_time2long</code>).</dd>
      <dt>pvals</dt>
      <dd>A logical vector of length 1 or 2.  If
  element 2 is blank element 1 will be recycled.  If the
  first element is <code>TRUE</code> pvalues will be calculated
  for the combined (main) output for all repeated measures
  from simulated resampling of the data.  If the second
  element is <code>TRUE</code> pvalues will be calculated for the
  individual (extended) repeated measures output from
  simulated resampling of the data.  Default is to
  calculate pvalues for the main output but not for the
  extended output.  This process involves multiple
  resampling of the data and is a time consuming process.
  It may take from a few minutes to days to calculate the
  pvalues depending on the number of all codes use, number
  of different codes and number of <code>replications</code>.</dd>
      <dt>replications</dt>
      <dd>An integer value for the number of
  replications used in resampling the data if any
  <code>pvals</code> is <code>TRUE</code>.  It is recommended that this
  value be no lower than 1000. Failure to use enough
  replications may result in unreliable pvalues.</dd>
      <dt>parallel</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> runs the
  <code>cm_distance</code> on multiple cores (if available).
  This will generally be effective with most data sets,
  given there are repeated measures, because of the large
  number of simulations.  Default uses 1/2 of the available
  cores.</dd>
      <dt>extended.output</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> the
  information on individual repeated measures is calculated
  in addition to the aggregated repeated measures results
  for the main output.</dd>
      <dt>time.var</dt>
      <dd>An optional variable to split the
  dataframe by (if you have data that is by various times
  this must be supplied).</dd>
      <dt>code.var</dt>
      <dd>The name of the code variable column.
  Defaults to "codes" as out putted by x2long family.</dd>
      <dt>causal</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> measures the
  distance between x and y given that x must precede y.
  That is, only those <code class = 'eq'>y_i</code> that begin after the
  <code class = 'eq'>x_i</code> has begun will be considered, as it is assumed
  that x precedes y.  If <code>FALSE</code> x is not assumed to
  precede y.  The closest <code class = 'eq'>y_i</code> (either its beginning
  or end) is calculated to <code class = 'eq'>x_i</code> (either it's beginning
  or end).</dd>
      <dt>start.var</dt>
      <dd>The name of the start variable column.
  Defaults to "start" as out putted by x2long family.</dd>
      <dt>end.var</dt>
      <dd>The name of the end variable column.
  Defaults to "end" as out putted by x2long family.</dd>
      <dt>cores</dt>
      <dd>An integer value describing the number of
  cores to use if <code>parallel = TRUE</code>.  Default is to
  use half of the available cores.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <div class="Value">
      <h2>Value</h2>
      
      <p>An object of the class <code>"cm_distance"</code>.  This is a
list with the following components:</p>
  
      <p>pvalsA logical indication of whether pvalues were
calculated replicationsInteger value of number of
replications used extended.outputAn optional list
of individual repeated measures information
main.outputA list of aggregated repeated measures
information adj.alphaAn adjusted alpha level
(based on <code class = 'eq'>\alpha = .05</code>) for the estimated p-values
using the upper end of the confidence interval around the
p-values</p>
  
      <p>Within the lists of extended.output and list of the
main.output are the following items:</p>
  
      <p>meanA distance matrix of average distances between
codes sdA matrix of standard deviations of
distances between codes nA matrix of counts of
distances between codes stan.meanA matrix of
standardized values of distances between codes.  The closer
a value is to zero the closer two codes relate.
pvalueA n optional matrix of simulated pvalues
associated with the mean distances</p>

    <div class="Description">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      
      <p>Generate distance measures to ascertain a mean distance
measure between codes.</p>
  
    </div>

    <div class="Details">
      <h2>Details</h2>
      
      <p>Note that row names are the first code and column names are
the second comparison code. The values for Code A compared
to Code B will not be the same as Code B compared to Code
A. This is because, unlike a true distance measure,
cm_distance's matrix is asymmetrical. <code>cm_distance</code>
computes the distance by taking each span (start and end)
for Code A and comparing it to the nearest start or end for
Code B.</p>
  
    </div>

    <div class="Warning">
      <h2>Warning</h2>
      
      <p>p-values are estimated and thus subject to error.  More
  replications decreases the error.  Use:</p>
  
      <p><pre class = 'eq'>p \pm \left ( 1.96 \cdot
  \sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}}\right )</code></p>
  
      <p>to adjust the confidence in the estimated p-values based
  on the number of replications.</p>
