<strong class='message'>===================================
Event 1: [lines 23-25]

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

 ** ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world &lt;&lt;so that&gt;&gt; people can get the choice
            of different plans at lower cost, better quality.

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition. 

===================================
Event 2: [lines 29-31]

    OBAMA:  That&#39;s what they do.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere. 

===================================
Event 3: [lines 34-36]

    OBAMA:  And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan
            would weaken Medicare substantially.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;that&#39;s why&gt;&gt; they were supportive of the approach
            that we took.

    OBAMA:  One last point I want to make. 

===================================
Event 4: [lines 40-42]

    LEHRER: OK.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt;|

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s that&#39;s a big topic. 

===================================
Event 5: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

 ** ROMNEY: I mean, you have to have regulations &lt;&lt;so that&gt;&gt; you can
            have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 

===================================
Event 6: [lines 106-108]

    OBAMA:  Now, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

 ** OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given,
            &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford. 

===================================
Event 7: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, &lt;&lt;in order to&gt;&gt; make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 

===================================
Event 8: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; we can know how you&#39;re going to wind
            things down if you make a bad bet &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; we don&#39;t have
            other taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 

===================================
Event 9: [lines 119-121]

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; the question is: Does anybody out there think
            that the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate. 

===================================
Event 10: [lines 128-130]

    ROMNEY: It wasn&#39;t thought through properly.

 ** ROMNEY: We need to get rid of that provision &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; it&#39;s
            killing regional and small banks.

    ROMNEY: They&#39;re getting hurt. 

===================================
Event 11: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
            not qualified, there are big penalties, except they
            didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage
            was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 

===================================
Event 12: [lines 139-141]

    ROMNEY: Try and get a mortgage these days.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; Dodd Frank
            didn&#39;t anticipate putting in place the kinds of
            regulations you have to have.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation. 

===================================
Event 13: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: I will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our of
            our marketplace and our business, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; I want to
            bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 

===================================
Event 14: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 

===================================
Event 15: [lines 181-183]

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;as a consequence&gt;&gt;, they&#39;re paying their
            premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they
            don&#39;t have enough money to pay the bills, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; the
            insurance companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country. 

===================================
Event 16: [lines 182-184]

    OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;as a consequence&gt;&gt;, they&#39;re paying their
            premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they
            don&#39;t have enough money to pay the bills, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; the
            insurance companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

 ** OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country.

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. 

===================================
Event 17: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me,
            was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work really
            well in Massachusetts, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; Governor Romney did a
            good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up
            what is essentially the identical model and &lt;&lt;as a
            consequence&gt;&gt; people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 

===================================
Event 18: [lines 196-198]

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;as a consequence&gt;&gt;, we now have a system in which
            we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as
            opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the
            cold.

    LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; Dodd Frank
            didn&#39;t anticipate putting in place the kinds of
            regulations you have to have.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation. 

===================================
Event 4: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: I will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our of
            our marketplace and our business, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; I want to
            bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 

===================================
Event 5: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 

===================================
Event 6: [lines 181-183]

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;as a consequence&gt;&gt;, they&#39;re paying their
            premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they
            don&#39;t have enough money to pay the bills, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; the
            insurance companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country. 

===================================
Event 7: [lines 182-184]

    OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;so&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;as a consequence&gt;&gt;, they&#39;re paying their
            premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they
            don&#39;t have enough money to pay the bills, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; the
            insurance companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

 ** OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country.

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. 

===================================
Event 8: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me,
            was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work really
            well in Massachusetts, &lt;&lt;because&gt;&gt; Governor Romney did a
            good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up
            what is essentially the identical model and &lt;&lt;as a
            consequence&gt;&gt; people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.
